# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You will need to already have a code editor and npm on your computer before getting started.

## First Step: Clone

firstly you will want to clone this repository so that you have a copy of my project. 

## Second Step: npm install

Sencondly you will want to open then project in your code editor(Vs code recommended).

Once the project is opened in your editor, you will open a terminal and run an npm install to install all your node modules and dependencies.
(you should have npm already downloaded).

Finally after installing after running your npm install you can now use my project, so you now write an npm start command in your terminal and my project 
will be launched in development mode.
